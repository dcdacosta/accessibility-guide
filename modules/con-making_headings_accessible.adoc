[role="_abstract"]
Headings play a key role in the accessibility of any document. They are essential for navigating and finding information quickly. They are used for navigation by screen reader users and they provide a clear structure of the document, making it easier to scan through the content. To ensure the accessibility of your documents, headings should:

* Be created using proper asciidoc tagging.
* Convey a clear and accurate structural outline of the sections of content.
* Accurately describe the content.
* Not skip hierarchical levels.
